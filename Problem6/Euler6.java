 ***************** DISCLAIMER ***************** 
 * This program is written so you can find the difference between the sum of squares and the square of the sum of
 * ANY number, simply call the class and enter your new variable.
 *
 *The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
 *
 * 12 + 22 + ... + 102 = 385
 * The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
 *
 * (1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025
 * Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.
 * 
 * * Beginning psuedocode:
 * * Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
 * * array of 100 natural numbers
 * * iterate through each, raise to second power and add each
 * * array of 100 natural numbers
 * * sum each one, raise the sum by power of two
 * * minus second sum by first sum
